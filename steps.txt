1 	list road teams opponents and find avg points scored and points allowed

2 	add the points scored and find the average then add the points allowed and find the 		average

3 	divide road teams points scored by the opponents average points allowed = offensive 		percentage

4 	divide road teams points allowed by the opponents average points scored = defensive 		percentage 

5	list home teams opponents and find the average points scored and points allowed	

6	add the points scored and find the average then add the points allowed and find the 		average

7	divide the road teams points scored by the opponents average points allowed = offensive 	percentage

8	divide the roadteams points allowed by the opponents average points scored = defensive 		percentage

9	add road teams offensive percentage to home teams defensive percentage and divide by 2 		= road performance figure

10	add home teams offensive percentage to home teams defensive percentage and divide by 2 		= home performance figure

11	add road teams points scored to home teams points allowed and divide by 2 = road 		offensive number

12	add home teams points scored to home road teams points allowed and divide by 2 = home 		offensive number

13	multiply road offensive number by road performance figure and subtract 2 this is their 		expected points 

14	multiply home offensive number by home performance figure and add 2 this is their 		expected points
